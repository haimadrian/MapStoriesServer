Follow these instructions in order to install Map Stories Server as a Windows Service.
This way Map Stories Server will be launched immediately when Windows starts up, and there is no need to login in order to launch it.

1. Refer here to download winsw.exe: https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/com/sun/winsw/winsw/
2. Make sure you have defined JAVA_HOME environment variable and put %JAVA_HOME%\bin at the PATH environment variable. We depend on a JVM (version 11+) in order to run.
3. Create a configuration file at the installation directory, and name it as the service identifier: MapStoriesServer.xml
   Content of the XML:
	<service>
		<id>MapStoriesServer</id>
		<name>Map Stories Server</name>
		<description>This runs Map Stories Server as a Service.</description>
		<env name="MYAPP_HOME" value="%BASE%"/>
		<executable>java</executable>
		<arguments>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Xms64m -Xmx4G -showversion -jar "%BASE%\map-stories-server-1.0.0.jar"</arguments>
		<logmode>rotate</logmode>
	</service>
4. Rename winsw.exe file to MapStoriesServer.exe and move it to the installation directory, next to the xml file.
5. Copy the map-stories-server-1.0.0.jar file to the same folder, next to MapStoriesServer.exe
6. Open cmd at the folder you saved MapStoriesServer.exe
7. Write: MapStoriesServer.exe install
8. Press enter
9. Good job, you have map-stories-server installed as a service.


Appendix:
Explanation about the runtime arguments we use:
HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError - To have a heapdump when there is OutOfMemory, so we can analyze it and find memory leaks, if I've made them...
Minimum memory: 64 Mega.
Maximum memory: 4 Giga.

Note that we log information to C:\BraveTogether\log by default. 
It is modifiable, to support running the server on a Linux machine. 
For this, you need to specify a jvm system property: org.bravetogether.mapstories.logdir that refers to the log folder. 
For example:
		<arguments>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError "-Dorg.bravetogether.mapstories.logdir=%BASE%\log" -Xms64m -Xmx4G -showversion -jar "%BASE%\map-stories-server-1.0.0.jar"</arguments>
This will use a log directory under base installation directory.
